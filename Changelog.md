### Change Log - v0.0.2: Expanded Feature Set and MediMate AI Enhancements

#### New Features:

- **US Army Body Fat Calculator**: Calculate body fat percentage based on the US Army standards.
  
- **US Navy Body Fat Calculator**: Determine body fat percentage using the US Navy method.

- **Estimated Average Glucose (eAG)**: Estimate average blood glucose levels over a specified period.

- **Estimated Energy Requirement (EER)**: Calculate the daily energy intake required for maintaining energy balance.

- **Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)**: Determine total energy expenditure including basal metabolic rate and physical activity level.

- **Basal Energy Expenditure (BEE)**: Calculate the energy expended at rest without any additional activity.

- **Total Energy Expenditure (TEE)**: Assess the total energy expended throughout the day, including basal metabolic rate and physical activity.

- **Micronutrient Requirements**: Calculate daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals based on individual characteristics.

- **MediMate Stroke Prediction**: Introduce the MediMate AI Model endpoint for Stroke Prediction, offering accurate predictions on the likelihood of an individual having a stroke based on health-related features.

- **MediMate Calorie Burn Prediction**: Introduce the MediMate Calorie Burn Prediction endpoint, leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning to estimate calorie burn during exercise routines.

#### What is it?

Introducing our MediMate AI Model endpoint for Stroke Prediction! This powerful tool allows users to predict the likelihood of an individual having a stroke based on several health-related features. Our machine learning model, meticulously trained on a stroke prediction dataset, delivers accurate predictions with ease.

#### Whatâ€™s New?

Introducing the MediMate Calorie Burn Prediction endpoint! This cutting-edge feature enables users to estimate the number of calories burned during exercise routines. Our state-of-the-art machine learning model takes individual characteristics such as gender, age, height, and weight, as well as exercise parameters like duration, heart rate, and body temperature to provide precise calorie burn estimates during a 1 to 30 minutes exercise in kilocalories (kcal).
