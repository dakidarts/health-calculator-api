## Change Log:

##### (March, 2025)  

#### v0.0.3: Expanded Feature Set  

### New Features:  

ðŸš€ **Added 17 new API endpoints for advanced health calculations:**  

**Ponderal Index Calculator** - Calculates the Ponderal Index to assess weight distribution relative to height.

**Karvonen Formula Calculator** - Determines target heart rate zones using the Karvonen method based on age and resting heart rate.

**Geriatric BMI Calculator** - Computes BMI for older adults with adjusted interpretation based on age.

**Daily Vitamin Calculator** - Estimates recommended daily vitamin intake based on age, gender, and lifestyle factors.

**Keto Calculator** - Calculates macronutrient intake for a ketogenic diet based on weight, activity level, and fitness goals.

**Body Roundness Index (BRI) Calculator** - Measures body roundness and fat distribution to assess health risks.

**Lean Body Mass (LBM) Calculator** - Computes lean body mass using the Boer formula for men and women.

**Body Surface Area (BSA) Calculator** - Determines body surface area using formulas like Du Bois, Mosteller, and others.

**Blood Sugar Converter** - Converts blood glucose levels between mmol/L and mg/dL units.

**Diabetes Risk Calculator** - Predicts Type 2 Diabetes risk over the next 7.5 years based on medical research and key health metrics.

**HOMA-IR Calculator** - Calculates the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance, a key marker of insulin sensitivity.

**QUICKI Calculator** - Computes the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index for assessing insulin resistance.

**Cholesterol Ratio Calculator** - Determines cholesterol ratios (TC/HDL, LDL/HDL, and TG/HDL) to assess cardiovascular risk.

**Cholesterol Units Converter** - Converts cholesterol levels between mg/dL and mmol/L for TC, HDL, and LDL.

**Triglycerides Concentration Converter** - Converts triglyceride values between mg/dL and mmol/L.

**VLDL Calculator** - Estimates Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) using Friedewald and Wilson equations.

**LDL Calculator** - Computes Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) using the Friedewald equation based on TC, HDL, and TG values. 

ðŸ”¹ **All endpoints support both GET & POST requests.**  
ðŸ”¹ **Metric & Imperial units are supported where applicable.**  
ðŸ”¹ **Improved response accuracy and error handling.**
